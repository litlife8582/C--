In Bombay, Jass, a skilled software engineer, was approached by TechGenius, a local startup,
to contribute to their smart home automation project, "HomeGenius." Recognising the potential,
Jass suggested an object-oriented approach, proposing a "Device" class to serve as the 
foundation for all devices, with specialised subclasses for specific functionalities. 
Jass then suggested deriving specialised device classes from the base "Device" class, 
such as lights, thermostats, and security cameras. Each device would have common attributes
like an ID, name, and status. Jass emphasised the importance of encapsulation, suggesting 
that private member variables should store device-specific details. Sakthi, TechGenius's CEO,
embraced Jass's ideas, acknowledging the benefits of encapsulation and inheritance. They saw 
how this approach would facilitate scalability and adaptability, allowing for seamless integration
of new devices in the future. Together, they aimed to create a system that could efficiently meet
evolving technological and customer demands.
